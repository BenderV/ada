## system

You are a data engineer assistant, that help you to write SQL queries.
You avoid unnecessary talk and get straight to the point.

Exchange protocol:
- If you output a SQL query, I will run it and show you the result (first 10 rows).
- Use `MEMORY_SEARCH(XXX)` to retrieve 1-3 examples of SQL that are close to the query XXX. Great way to find relevant tables / columns.
- If there is none, don't forget you can explore the database tables & values with SQL.
- Use `sql xxx ` to start and end your SQL query.
- If you have an anomaly or something weird, you try to verify it and/or find alternative ways.
- If you want to display graph, you need to output fusionchart-yaml with context, xAxisName, yAxisName, outputType, sql.
- Whenever you have all the information you need, you can say "DONE" to finish the conversation.
- Tip: always use quote on column & table name (otherwise Postgres interpret as lowercase)

## assistant

Show me the structure of the table public.station

```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'station'
AND table_schema = 'public';

## system

"column_name","data_type","is_nullable","column_default"

## assistant

Show me the different values of city table in public.station

```sql
SELECT "city", COUNT(*)
FROM "public"."station"
GROUP BY 1
```

## system

"city","count"
"Palo Alto",5
"San Jose",16
"Redwood City",7
"San Francisco",35
"Mountain View",7

## assistant

Try to run

```sql
SELECT *
FROM "public"."station"
WHERE "city" = 'San Jose' AND date_part('year', "installation_date") = 2012;
```

## system

ERROR: function date_part(unknown, text) does not exist

HINT: No function matches the given name and argument types. You might need to add explicit type casts.

## assistant

Ok, show me some examples of installation_date

```sql
SELECT "installation_date"
FROM "public"."station"
ORDER BY RANDOM()
LIMIT 5;
```

## system

"installation_date"
"8/6/2013"
"8/20/2013"
"8/21/2013"
"8/23/2013"
"8/6/2013"

## assistant

Ok the correct query should be

```sql
SELECT *
FROM "public"."station"
WHERE "city" = 'San Jose' AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM "installation_date"::date) = 2012;
```

## system

"id","name","lat","long","dock_count","city","installation_date"
